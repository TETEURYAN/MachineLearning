# Classification Algorithms in Machine Learning

Classification algorithms in machine learning are techniques used to categorize data points into predefined classes or categories based on their features or attributes. These algorithms are a fundamental part of supervised learning, where the model is trained on labeled data to make predictions on unseen data.

## Algorithms:

1. **Logistic Regression**: Despite its name, logistic regression is a linear model used for binary classification. It estimates the probability that a given input belongs to a certain class.

``` python
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

2. **Decision Trees**: Decision trees split the data into subsets based on the value of input features. Each internal node represents a feature, each branch represents a decision rule, and each leaf node represents the outcome or class label.

``` python
model = DecisionTreeClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

3. **Random Forest**: Random forest is an ensemble learning method that constructs a multitude of decision trees during training and outputs the mode of the classes (classification) or the mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.

``` python
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```


4. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: SVMs are powerful supervised learning models used for classification and regression analysis. They find the hyperplane that best separates the classes in the feature space.

``` python
model = SVC()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

5. **Naive Bayes**: Naive Bayes classifiers are based on Bayes' theorem with the assumption of independence between features. Despite this oversimplified assumption, they often perform well and are efficient in practice.

``` python
model = GaussianNB()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

6. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: KNN is a simple and intuitive algorithm that classifies a data point based on the majority class among its k nearest neighbors in the feature space.

``` python
model = KNeighborsClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

7. **Neural Networks**: Neural networks, especially deep learning models, can perform classification tasks by learning hierarchical representations of the data. They consist of multiple layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) that transform input data into useful representations.
