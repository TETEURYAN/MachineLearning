## Types of Machine Learning

### 1. Supervised Learning
In supervised learning, the algorithm learns from labeled data, where each example is associated with a target label. The goal is to learn a mapping from input features to the target labels.

### 2. Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data, where the algorithm tries to find hidden patterns or structures in the data. Clustering and dimensionality reduction are common tasks in unsupervised learning.

### 3. Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning involves training an agent to make decisions in an environment to achieve a certain goal. The agent learns by receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties for its actions.
