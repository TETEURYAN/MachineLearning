# Regression Algorithms

Regression algorithms in machine learning are used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The goal is to predict continuous numeric values.

## Types of Regression Algorithms

### 1. Linear Regression
Linear regression models the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable by fitting a linear equation to the observed data.

### 2. Polynomial Regression
Polynomial regression extends linear regression by fitting a polynomial equation to the data, allowing for more complex relationships between the variables.

### 3. Ridge Regression
Ridge regression is a regularization technique that adds a penalty term to the linear regression objective function to prevent overfitting.

### 4. Lasso Regression
Lasso regression is another regularization technique that adds an L1 penalty term to the linear regression objective function, leading to sparse solutions by encouraging some coefficients to be exactly zero.

### 5. ElasticNet Regression
ElasticNet regression combines the penalties of ridge and lasso regression, allowing for both variable selection and regularization.

### 6. Decision Tree Regression
Decision tree regression models the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable by partitioning the feature space into regions and fitting a simple model (e.g., a constant value) in each region.

### 7. Random Forest Regression
Random forest regression is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and robustness.

### 8. Support Vector Regression (SVR)
SVR extends support vector machines to regression problems by finding a hyperplane that best fits the data while minimizing prediction errors.

### 9. Gradient Boosting Regression
Gradient boosting regression builds an ensemble of weak learners (e.g., decision trees) sequentially, with each new model correcting the errors of the previous ones.
